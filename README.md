# Compressive-Strength-of-Concrete-app
In this project, machine learning algorithms were used to develop a model to predict the compressive strength of concrete. The machine learning algorithm used in this project were; KNearest Neighbour, Random Forest Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. The use of nano cement is an effective way to minimize environmental pollution and increase the strength of concrete. Ultimately, this reduces the amount of cement used in the production of concrete. The performance of our model was measured with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (RÂ²).
Indepth exploratory analysis was done in the "EDA- Nanotech" file, while the "Model and prediction" file contains the steps taken in performiing future engineering, model training, and model evaluation before arriving at the best model to use.
The api.py file was where the model was wrapped using FastAPI before being deployed on Heroku.
